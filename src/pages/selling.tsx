        <h3 className="text-md font-medium">The Price is Right</h3>
        <p className="text-zinc-800 leading-relaxed">
          No one understands the area’s housing market more than the Management Properties team. Our blend of local knowledge built up over two decades, combined with our unique understanding of the North West London housing market, means that we can secure the optimal price for the property you’re selling.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-md font-medium">Exposure, exposure, exposure</h3>
        <p className="text-zinc-800 leading-relaxed">
          At Management Properties we employ the latest high profile advertising and marketing techniques to ensure your home is viewed by the widest possible number of home buyers. Our professional photography equipment will capture your home’s best features. Your home will then be advertised on all the major property website portals; not only will this maximize your home’s sales appeal, this gives potential buyers access to all the information they need, eliminating time-wasters.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-md font-medium">Buyer Alert</h3>
        <p className="text-zinc-800 leading-relaxed">
          As soon as your property is listed with Management Properties, we issue an automatic alert to thousands of interested home buyers. In addition, unlike other estate agents, we have optimised our online search facility so that potential buyers can locate the full scope of your home’s details quickly and efficiently. However, we still use traditional methods and our experienced sales team ensure that they remain personally familiar with our current buyers’ specific requirements.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-md font-medium">Prime Location</h3>
        <p className="text-zinc-800 leading-relaxed">
          Being located in the heart of Maida Hill, your home’s profile will be exposed to one of the most desirable areas in London for new buyers, investors & home movers. Whether you’re looking to move quickly or are curious to see just how much Management Properties could secure for your home, call us for an up to date realistic valuation. We’re committed to ensuring you get the price your home deserves.
